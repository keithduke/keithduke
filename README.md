# 👋 Hi, I'm Keith Duke

**Full-Stack Engineer · Agentic AI & LLM Systems · New Media & Games**

I'm a full-stack engineer with 13+ years of experience shipping products at scale, including a decade as a Lead/Senior engineer working on web properties at CBS Interactive (now Paramount). These days I'm focused on:

- Building **agentic frameworks** for local LLMs on Apple Silicon
- Crafting **text-driven games** that feel like living stories
- Treating **code as writing**—to both humans and machines

---

## 🔭 What I’m working on

- **T.O.M. Framework** – A minimal, hackable agent framework for running local “thinking” models (like Qwen3-4B-Thinking) on Apple Silicon with tools, memory, and a CLI front-end.  
  <sub>Repo: [`TOM-framework`](https://github.com/keithduke/TOM-framework)</sub>

- **Dunil’s Hold** – A macOS iOS project I am currently heads down on. There will be more details VERY soon.

- **Personal Site & Writing** – Keeping a running log of what I’m building and thinking about.

## 🧩 Featured projects

- 🔧 **T.O.M. (Terminal Orchestrated Model) Framework**  
  Local, agentic LLM framework focused on:
  - Apple MLX + Apple Silicon
  - Tool-calling and scratchpad-based memory
  - Long-running CLI workflows  
  → [`TOM-framework`](https://github.com/keithduke/TOM-framework)

- 🌐 **Personal Website**  
  A small, fast site built with Vite and GitHub Pages, serving as my long-form “About” and project hub.

## 💬 How I like to work

- **Text-first experiences** – whether it’s a CLI, a roguelike, or documentation, I gravitate toward rich text and fast feedback loops.
- **Agents as tools, not toys** – I care about LLMs that call real tools, maintain context, and help with serious work.
- **Readable, maintainable code** – code is writing; I optimize for the next person (often future me) who has to read it.
